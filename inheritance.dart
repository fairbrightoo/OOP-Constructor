/**
 * Inheritance In Dart
Inheritance is a sharing of behaviour between two classes. It allows you to define a class that extends the functionality of another class. The extend keyword is used for inheriting from parent class.

Note: Whenever you use inheritance, it always create a is-a relation between the parent and child class like Student is a Person, Truck is a Vehicle, Cow is a Animal etc.

Syntax
class ParentClass {
  // Parent class code
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  // Child class code
}

Terminology
Parent Class: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class is called parent class. It is also known as base class or super class.
